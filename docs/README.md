# Introduction

Metadata enables you to unlock the value of data assets in the common use cases of data discovery and governance, but also in emerging use cases related to data quality, observability, and people collaboration. However, poorly organized and managed metadata leads to redundant efforts within organizations and other inefficiencies that are expensive in time and dollars.

### **OpenMetadata is an open standard with a centralized metadata store that unifies all your data assets end-to-end to enable data discovery, user collaboration, and tool interoperability.**

OpenMetadata includes the following:

* **Metadata schemas** - defines core abstractions and vocabulary for metadata with schemas for Types, Entities, and Relationships between entities. This is the foundation of the Open Metadata Standard.
* **Metadata store** - stores a metadata graph that connects data assets and user and tool generated metadata.
* **Metadata APIs** - for producing and consuming metadata built on schemas for User Interfaces and for Integrating tools, systems, and services.
* **Ingestion framework** - a pluggable framework for integrating tools and ingesting metadata to the metadata store. The ingestion framework already supports well-known data warehouses - Google BigQuery, Snowflake, Amazon Redshift, and Apache Hive and databases - MySQL, Postgres, Oracle, and MSSQL.
* **OpenMetadata User Interface** - a central place for users to discover and collaborate on all data.
